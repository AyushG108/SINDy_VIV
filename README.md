# SINDy_VIV
Sparse Identification of Non-Linear Dynamics (SINDy) is used to identify and discover non-linear dynamics of wake &amp; lift oscillator Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV) systems. 2 Reduced order VIV systems, namely, wake oscillator proposed by Fachinetti [1] (2003) &amp; an older model of lift oscillator proposed by Hartlen &amp; Curie [2] (1970) are studied.
